# clean-website
This "clean website" is intended as a starting point of standards-compliant content context that can efficiently be evolved into a functional website.

## Standards and Compliance Criteria
To ensure our project adheres to the highest standards of web development, we have outlined specific criteria for compliance. These include:

- **Web Accessibility**: Ensuring our website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.
- **Responsive Design**: Designing our website to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices (from desktop monitors to mobile phones).
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring our website functions correctly across different web browsers to provide a consistent user experience.

We are committed to maintaining these standards throughout the development process to create a truly standards-compliant website.
